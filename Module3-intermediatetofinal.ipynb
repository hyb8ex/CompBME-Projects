Common routes include (i) loss of p53-mediated DNA-damage death signals, (ii) mitochondrial pathway blockade via anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, (iii) up-regulation of survival signaling (PI3K–AKT), and (iv) decoy/death-receptor rewiring that blunts extrinsic death cues. The net effect is an overaccumulation of cells that lack the ability to recognize/act upon their diseased state. \n",

Survival time and event were derived from OS/OS.time when available, or from days_to_death or days_to_last_followup plus vital_status. When present, analyses were restricted to lung cancer samples (LUAD/LUSC). Expression features were standardized per feature and reduced with PCA to 30 principal components (approximately 71.8% variance; final matrix 135 × 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering model. We applied k-means (scikit-learn) with n_init=20 and random_state=42. To select the number of clusters, we evaluated k = 2–6 using a train/test split. The scaler and PCA and the k-means model were fit on the training set only, and test points were assigned to the training centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection and validation. The held-out silhouette score (range −1 to 1; higher indicates tighter, better-separated clusters) was the primary metric. We also report Calinski–Harabasz (larger is better) and Davies–Bouldin (smaller is better). To avoid degenerate solutions, we required at least two clusters represented in the test set, a minimum training cluster size of 5, and stability measured by the mean Adjusted Rand Index across 10 random restarts. Under these constraints, k = 2 was selected (test silhouette ≈ 0.31; ARI ≈ 1.00).\n",
    "\n",
    "Downstream analyses. We computed an apoptosis score using the HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS gene set and profiled clusters by size, apoptosis score, and event rate. For survival validation we plotted Kaplan–Meier curves with log-rank tests and fit a Cox proportional hazards model with cluster indicators (and apoptosis score where noted).

    "We loaded the TCGA lung cancer RNA-seq dataset (LUAD/LUSC) and associated clinical metadata, then aligned samples between the expression matrix and metadata using the shared TCGA barcodes. From the expression matrix, we selected a curated set of apoptosis-related genes and standardized expression values (z-scores) across samples. We computed a composite apoptosis score for each tumor by averaging standardized expression of those genes. After subsetting to lung cancer samples with valid survival information, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize variation in tumors and assess whether apoptosis scoring corresponded to transcriptional patterns. We then fit a Cox proportional hazards model to determine whether the apoptosis score was associated with patient survival outcomes. Finally, we evaluated model significance and hazard ratios and interpreted results indicating that tumors with higher apoptosis-related transcriptional activity were associated with worse survival.\n"

    "k-means on 30 PCs selected k=2 (test silhouette ≈0.31; ARI ≈1.00). Clusters differ in apoptosis score and event rate, suggesting biologically meaningful separation consistent with lung-cancer literature. Ethically, unsupervised groups can reflect sampling or demographic bias; we avoid normative labels, report stability/held-out metrics, and would test fairness across subgroups (e.g., sex, age, smoking status) if used downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of results specific- higher apoptosis score was associated with worse survival rates with significance (p<0.005, cox proportional hazards ratio exp(coef): 1.44- hazard is increased by 44% [and to put that into context, HR > 1.0 is considered Increased risk], concordance=0.63 (moderate division)). To explain this biologically, higher expression of apoptotic genes could be a regulatory overexpression after failed attempts at apoptosis, or to offset pro and anti-apoptotic gene ratios (like BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic gene). \n",

    "Other Ethical implications:\n",
    "- racial or socioeconomic groups may be incorrectly represented/ ill calculated based on the model and prevalence/incidence splits of cancer type by race/etc.\n",
    "- a model like this would need rigorous validation as using this model to inform treatment decisions can lead to false reassurance\n",
    "- responsibility in providing access to resulting therapies also involves understanding prevalence/incidence demographic split and determining how to fill in the model with a more diverse demographic dataset to provide more representative/generalized results (only had 135 lung cancer samples, could expand that), and even change disease prognosis metrics- change model results"
